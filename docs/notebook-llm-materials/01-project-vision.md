# Dieta Positiva: Project Vision & Overview

## Executive Summary
Dieta Positiva is an AI-native wellness coaching platform designed to be "invisible." Unlike typical AI wrappers that show off chat interfaces, Dieta Positiva uses AI as infrastructure to deliver concrete wellness outcomes (nutrition, fitness, habit building) without the user necessarily feeling like they are talking to a robot.

## The Core Philosophy: "Invisible Technology"
The guiding principle of this project is that **technology should fade into the background**.
- **Bad AI App:** "Look, I'm a chatbot! Ask me anything about diet."
- **Dieta Positiva:** "Here is your grocery list for the week based on your preferences." (The AI generated it, but the interface is a simple list).

## The "3 Systems" Architecture
To build this effectively as a solo founder, the project is divided into three distinct systems:

1.  **System 1: DP AI (The "Brain")**
    *   **User:** You (The Founder/Business).
    *   **Goal:** Runs the business. Analyzes user data, generates content, helps make strategic decisions.
    *   **Nature:** Not visible to customers.

2.  **System 2: DP App (The "Product")**
    *   **User:** The Customer.
    *   **Goal:** Solve their wellness problems.
    *   **Nature:** A clean, simple web application (SaaS). This is what people pay for.

3.  **System 3: Agentic Workflow (The "Factory")**
    *   **User:** You + AI Agents (like Claude).
    *   **Goal:** To build Systems 1 and 2 extremely fast.
    *   **Nature:** Scripts, prompts, and workflows (like the one you are using right now) that accelerate coding and deployment.

## Current Status
You are currently in the **Setup Phase**.
- **Done:** Project structure, tech stack selection, core architectural decisions.
- **Next:** Building the internal "Brain" (System 1) and the customer-facing "Product" (System 2).
